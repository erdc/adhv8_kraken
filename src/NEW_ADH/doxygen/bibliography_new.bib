    abstract = { Abstract The error in computing the pressure gradient force near steep topography using terms following (œÉ) coordinates is investigated in an ocean model using the family of vertical differencing schemes proposed by Arakawa and Suarez. The truncation error is estimated by substituting known buoyancy profiles into the finite difference hydrostatic and pressure gradient terms. The error due to ‚Äúhydrostatic inconsistency,‚Äù which is not simply a space truncation error, is also documented. The results show that the pressure gradient error is spread throughout the water column, and it is sensitive to the vertical resolution and to the placement of the grid points relative to the vertical structure of the buoyancy field being modeled. Removing a reference state, as suggested for the atmosphere by Gary, reduces the truncation error associated with the two lowest vertical modes by a factor of 2 to 3. As an example, the error in computing the pressure gradient using a standard 10-level primitive equation model applied to buoyancy profiles and topographic slopes typical of the California Current region corresponds to a false geostrophic current of the order of 10‚Äì12 cm s‚àí1. The analogous error in a hydrostatically consistent 30-level model with the reference state removed is about an order of magnitude smaller. }

    abstract = { Abstract Much has been written of the error in computing the horizontal pressure gradient associated with sigma coordinates in ocean or atmospheric numerical models. There also exists the concept of ‚Äúhydrostatic inconsistency‚Äù whereby, for a given horizontal resolution, increasing the vertical resolution may not be numerically convergent. In this paper, it is shown that the differencing scheme cited here, though conventional, is not hydrostatically inconsistent; the sigma coordinate, pressure gradient error decreases with the square of the vertical and horizontal grid size. Furthermore, it is shown that the pressure gradient error is advectively eliminated after a long time integration. At the other extreme, it is shown that diagnostic calculations of the North Atlantic Ocean using rather coarse resolution, and where the temperature and salinity and the pressure gradient error are held constant, do not exhibit significant differences when compared to a calculation where horizontal pressure gradients are computed on z-level coordinates. Finally, a way of canceling the error ab initio is suggested. }

While both models aim at modeling coastal to basin-scale problems using similar grids, their numerical algorithms, code structure, and parameterization options are very different. Sensitivity studies with an idealized channel flow and a steep seamount configuration demonstrate how different algorithms in the two models may affect numerical errors, the stability of the code and the computational efficiency. For example, new pressure gradient schemes using polynomial fits and new time stepping algorithms may reduce numerical errors and allow using longer time steps than standard schemes do. However, the new schemes may require more careful choices of time steps and the use of higher order advection schemes to maintain numerical stability. "

The unstructured, implicit, Petrov-Galerkin finite-element model relies on computed residuals to automatically adjust the time-step size. The implicit time integration, together with the automatic time-step size selection through PTC, makes the model computationally efficient. The model is verified and applied to several analytic and real-world test cases that exercise model behavior and accuracy for several critical, transcritical, and subcritical flows. The result is an efficient and accurate prediction of both the speed and depth of shock waves as the dam-break flow passes over initially dry and wet land. }

However, opportunities for improving the accuracy of this type of models were identified during extensive simulations of a tightly coupled estuary‚Äìplume‚Äìshelf system in the Columbia River system. Efforts to improve numerical accuracy resulted in SELFE, a new finite-element model for cross-scale ocean modeling. \{SELFE\} retains key benefits, including computational efficiency of existing semi-implicit Eulerian‚ÄìLagrangian finite-volume models, but relaxes restrictions on grids, uses higher-order shape functions for elevation, and enables superior flexibility in representing the bathymetry. Better representation of the bathymetry is enabled by a novel, ‚Äúlocalized‚Äù vertical grid that resembles unstructured grids. At a particular horizontal location, \{SELFE\} uses either S coordinates or \{SZ\} coordinates, but the equations are consistently solved in Z space. \{SELFE\} also performs well relative to volume conservation and spurious oscillations, two problems that plague some finite-element models. This paper introduces \{SELFE\} as an open-source code available for community use and enhancement. The main focus here is on describing the formulation of the model and on showing results for a range of progressively demanding benchmark tests. While leaving details to separate publications, we also briefly illustrate the superior performance of \{SELFE\} over \{ELCIRC\} in a field application to the Columbia River estuary and plume. "

    abstract = { Abstract Large-scale free-surface ocean models designed to run over climatic time scales are required to globally conserve the volume and any tracer up to machine precision. In addition, local consistency is critical and requires that the discrete tracer equation preserve constants in a closed domain and if there is no tracer source or sink. Local consistency, together with monotonicity, will ensure that no spurious tracer extrema occur. A three-dimensional, finite-element, shallow-water model is presented. The mesh is unstructured in the horizontal, extruded in the third dimension, and made up of multiple layers of prisms. In addition, the mesh is allowed to move in the vertical and adapts itself to the free-surface motions. It is shown that achieving consistency requires a discrete compatibility between the tracer and continuity equations. In addition, to ensure global tracer conservation in a consistent way, a discrete compatibility between the tracer, continuity, and free-surface elevation equations must be fulfilled. It is suggested that this compatibility constraint, together with the use of a numerically stable scheme, severely restricts the choice of usable finite-element spatial discretizations. A consistent and conservative time-stepping algorithm is described for which a unique time step is used. It is suggested that future research is needed in order to design a consistent and conservative split-explicit algorithm. Some illustrative test cases are presented in which the method is shown to satisfy all conservation properties. A few experiments in which consistency breaks down are carried out, and the consequences of this breakdown process are investigated. }

    abstract = { Abstract Quantitative approaches to the evaluation of model performance were recently examined by Fox (1981). His recommendations are briefly reviewed and a revised set of performance statistics is proposed. It is suggested that the correlation between model-predicted and observed data, commonly described by Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient, is an insufficient and often misleading measure of accuracy. A complement of differenec and summary univariate indices is presented as the nucleus of a more informative, albeit fundamentally descriptive, approach to model evaluation. Two models that estimate monthly evapotranspiration are comparatively evaluated in order illustrate how the recommended method(s) can be applied. }

Both, quadrilateral and triangular elements utilizing, bilinear (Q1Q1) and linear (P1P1) interpolation functions, respectively, are considered. Stabilized finite-element formulations are employed to solve the incompressible Navier‚ÄìStokes equations in the primitive variables. The element length, h, plays an important role in the calculation of stabilizing coefficients in the formulation. Three definitions of h are utilized. These are based on the maximum edge length, minimum edge length of an element and the element length along the streamwise direction. Performance of the implementations is evaluated for both, steady and unsteady flows. Numerical experiments are conducted for flow past a circular cylinder at Reynolds numbers 10 and 100. While in the former case the flow is steady, the latter one is associated with temporally periodic vortex shedding. It is observed that for the Re=10 flow all definitions of h produce acceptable solutions even with elements that have very high aspect ratios. In the case of Re=100 flow, again, all definitions of h work well for elements with reasonable/low aspect ratios. However, for large aspect ratio elements it is only the definition based on the minimum edge length of an element that results in acceptable solution. It is also observed that the effect of high aspect ratio is felt more by the \{P1P1\} element as compared to the \{Q1Q1\} element. "

   abstract = "Storm surge due to hurricanes and tropical storms can result in significant loss of life, property damage, and long-term damage to coastal ecosystems and landscapes. Computer modeling of storm surge can be used for two primary purposes: forecasting of surge as storms approach land for emergency planning and evacuation of coastal populations, and hindcasting of storms for determining risk, development of mitigation strategies, coastal restoration and sustainability. Storm surge is modeled using the shallow water equations, coupled with wind forcing and in some events, models of wave energy. In this paper, we will describe a depth-averaged (2D) model of circulation in spherical coordinates. Tides, riverine forcing, atmospheric pressure, bottom friction, the Coriolis effect and wind stress are all important for characterizing the inundation due to surge. The problem is inherently multi-scale, both in space and time. To model these problems accurately requires significant investments in acquiring high-fidelity input (bathymetry, bottom friction characteristics, land cover data, river flow rates, levees, raised roads and railways, etc.), accurate discretization of the computational domain using unstructured finite element meshes, and numerical methods capable of capturing highly advective flows, wetting and drying, and multi-scale features of the solution. The discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method appears to allow for many of the features necessary to accurately capture storm surge physics. The \{DG\} method was developed for modeling shocks and advection-dominated flows on unstructured finite element meshes. It easily allows for adaptivity in both mesh (h) and polynomial order (p) for capturing multi-scale spatial events. Mass conservative wetting and drying algorithms can be formulated within the \{DG\} method. In this paper, we will describe the application of the \{DG\} method to hurricane storm surge. We discuss the general formulation, and new features which have been added to the model to better capture surge in complex coastal environments. These features include modifications to the method to handle spherical coordinates and maintain still flows, improvements in the stability post-processing (i.e. slope-limiting), and the modeling of internal barriers for capturing overtopping of levees and other structures. We will focus on applications of the model to recent events in the Gulf of Mexico, including Hurricane Ike. "

abstract = { Abstract The finite-element spatial discretization of the linear shallow-water equations on unstructured triangular meshes is examined in the context of a semi-implicit temporal discretization. Triangular finite elements are attractive for ocean modeling because of their flexibility for representing irregular boundaries and for local mesh refinement. The semi-implicit scheme is beneficial because it slows the propagation of the high-frequency small-amplitude surface gravity waves, thereby circumventing a severe time step restriction. High-order computationally expensive finite elements are, however, of little benefit for the discretization of the terms responsible for rapidly propagating gravity waves in a semi-implicit formulation. Low-order velocity/surface-elevation finite-element combinations are therefore examined here. Ideally, the finite-element basis-function pair should adequately represent approximate geostrophic balance, avoid generating spurious computational modes, and give a consistent discretization of the governing equations. Existing finite-element combinations fail to simultaneously satisfy all of these requirements and consequently suffer to a greater or lesser extent from noise problems. An unconventional and largely unknown finite-element pair, based on a modified combination of linear and constant basis functions, is shown to be a good compromise and to give good results for gravity-wave propagation. }

This paper describes the implementation and testing of an adaptive grid technique for the internal mode of shallow water models. The technique uses an r-method in which the nodes are moved vertically based on the velocity gradients between consecutive nodes. One-dimensional (1D) tests show that the method behaves well in tidal- and wind-driven flows, both in well-mixed and stratified conditions. Average accuracy improvements of 50\% were obtained relative to uniform grids, with a 15\% \{CPU\} time increase. The adaptive technique accounts accurately for the space and time variability of the flow, thus being attractive for any type of problem. Furthermore, the technique does not require an a priori knowledge of the flow conditions, thus simplifying greatly the modeling procedure. "

abstract = { One of the basic articles of discretization-based numerical modeling of three-dimensional shallow water equations is the spatial convergence of the mesh utilized. The process of creating a spatially converged mesh involves refining the mesh until the solution for the quantity of interest does not change within some user-defined tolerance. This process is cumbersome in three-dimensions, and in the absence of a spatially converged mesh, the numerical results may be erroneous. This technical note introduces a norm of the three-dimensional continuity equation residual-based refinement indicator to flag regions of the mesh requiring refinement. The method is implemented through h-adaption in a finite-element method‚Äìbased code and results of this implementation are presented. }

abstract = { The ability to accurately simulate sediment transport processes in natural and engineered systems is crucial to both engineers and scientists. Many researchers have worked on the development of methods that yield reliable predictions of both sediment transport and morphological change with a minimum of computational burden, so that the long prototype time scales necessary to appropriately investigate these processes can be simulated within a reasonable amount of time. This includes the development of tools for approximating the complex behavior of the sediment concentration in the water column. In this technical note, the classic equilibrium sediment profile first introduced by Rouse is revisited. Following the development of the Rouse profile introduced by Einstein, a generalized nonequilibrium sediment concentration profile is generated. The principal assumption is that the convective term of the nonequilibrium vertical sediment flux can be approximated with the relationship that arises from purely convective transport. The method is compared to numerical solutions for depositional profiles, and appears to yield promising results. }

    abstract = { Abstract An extended period numerical integration of a baroclinic primitive equation model has been made for the simulation and the study of the dynamics of the atmosphere's general circulation. The solution corresponding to external gravitational propagation is filtered by requiring the vertically integrated divergence to vanish identically. The vertical structure permits as dependent variables the horizontal wind at two internal levels and a single temperature, with the static stability entering as a parameter. The incoming radiation is a function of latitude only corresponding to the annual mean, and the outgoing radiation is taken to be a function of the local temperature. With the requirement for thermal equilibrium, the domain mean temperature is specified as a parameter. The role of condensation is taken into account only as it effectively reduces the static stability. All other external sources and sinks of heat are assumed to balance each other locally, and are thus omitted. The kinematics are that of a fluid on a sphere bounded by smooth zonal walls at the equator and at approximately 64¬∞ latitude. The dissipative sinks are provided by: (a) surface stresses proportional through a drag coefficient to the square of the surface wind which is suitably extrapolated from above, (b) internal convective stresses proportional to the vertical wind shear, and (c) lateral diffusion of momentum and heat through an exchange coefficient which depends on the local horizontal rate of strain‚Äîa horizontal length scale entering as the governing parameter. For a given specification of the parameters, an integration for 60 days has been made from initial conditions where random temperature disturbances have been superimposed on a zonally symmetric regime which is baroclinically unstable according to linear theory. This experiment not only displays the scale selective character of baroclinic instability, yielding zonal wave number 5 to 6, but also predicts an index or energy cycle. The period of this cycle is 11 to 12 days for the first 40 days of the experiment, then lengthening to 17 days while diminishing in amplitude during the latter part. The resulting mean zonal velocity profile is in good qualitative agreement with observation, but too intense, presumably because the effective static stability parameter is taken too large. Furthermore this profile is found to be no more than 5 percent super-geostrophic poleward of the angular momentum maximum and no more than 2 percent sub-geostrophic equatorward. The total zonal angular momentum remains constant to within 2 percent irrespective of the phase of the index cycle. This balance is controlled by the surface wind distribution which agrees quite well with observation. The poleward transport is mainly accomplished by the large-scale eddies, whereas the internal vertical flux is predominantly a transfer of the earth's angular momentum by the meridional circulation. The poleward heat transport is primarily accomplished by a Hadley circulation at low latitudes but by the large-scale horizontal eddies in mid-latitudes, where a Ferrel circulation tends to compensate through an equatorward flux. This compensation at mid-latitudes by an indirect meridional circulation is also quite evident, in the potential-kinetic energy transformations. Comparison of the momentum and heat transfer with observed data when available shows reasonably good quantitative agreement. The lateral transfer of momentum and heat by the non-linear diffusion, which parametrically is supposed to simulate the action of motions of sub-grid scale, accounts for a significant portion of the total eddy transfer. Although no direct comparison with the corresponding transfer in the real atmosphere is available, intuitively our small-scale diffusion appears to play too large a role. A diagnosis is made of the transformations among the baratropic and baroclinic parts of the kinetic energy as well as the zonal mean and zonal perturbation parts of the available potential and kinetic energy. This reveals the dominant paths that the energy passes through from source to ultimate sinks and the processes responsible for these transformations. It is found that the partitioning of dissipation by the energy components may differ considerably from estimates made from observation. }

abstract = { Hydrodynamic and water quality codes have been frequently linked. These have typically been linked with both the hydrodynamic and water quality models using similar explicit time steps, but for long-term simulations implicit models are required. The water quality codes linked to these hydrodynamic codes are forced to perform their computations using the hydrodynamic time step even though utilizing the same might result in drifting of the water quality solution. This technical note presents the development and testing of an operator splitting‚Äìderived method for linking hydrodynamic and water quality codes with adaptive time stepping. The resulting method provides high-fidelity solutions that compare well with analytic solutions and lends itself for extension to various other transported quantities. }

abstract = { Late summer 2010 saw record flooding of the Indus River in Pakistan. In response to requests by the U.S. Army, the writers provided flood extents to aid humanitarian assistance in the affected areas. Numerical modeling provided the best way to compute the flooding in this situation, but with limited bathymetric, topographic, and inflow information, assumptions had to be made; timelines were of significantly higher importance than complete accuracy. The writers developed an adaptive hydraulics (AdH) model of the Indus River from Sukkur to the Arabian Sea covering approximately 180,000 km2 of Pakistan. Based on aerial images taken during the flood, the writers later compared the model results to the flood extents to determine the level of accuracy of the model. The AdH model results approximately reproduced the area of flooding for initial emergency operations, even with little knowledge of the area and the inflow conditions. The results of this exercise show that rapid modeling of large-scale flooding is possible in emergency situations. This paper describes lessons learned and provides recommendations for similar future efforts. }
