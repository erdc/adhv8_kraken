Task List
(1) Multiple Material Overlays (NEW FEATURE) --- MARK/COREY
(2) Merge all branches** ---- COREY/MARK
(3) Auto physics change (NEW FEATURE)** ---- MARK (WORK IN PROGRESS)
(4) Generalized Coupling Framework (NEW FEATURE)** ---- MARK/COREY
(WORK IN PROGRESS)
(5) Flux-coupling (NEW FEATURE)** - maybe just for overlay coupling
now ---- COREY
(6) How to create/import complex multi-physics geometry setups (SMS??)
---- GAURAV/MARK/COREY
(7) Extrusion for GW too (not just SW3D) (NEW FEATURE) ---- ANYONE
(8) Re-frame sediment transport as just another model ----
GARY/MARK/COREY -- Happens during merge to Master
(9) Get rid of weird numeric card tokens - just do string comparisons
--- MARK
(10) Normalized residuals --- MARK 
(11) Add heat transport (NEW FEATURE) --- MARK/COREY
(12) Test other elements - quads/etc (NEW FEATURE) ---- MARK/COREY
(13) Scotch Domain Decomp  --- PET 
(14) Get rid of packing/unpacking --- PET/COREY/MARK


** time-consuming


Would be nice:
- General operator splitting framework (Strang Splitting, for example)
  ---- MARK/COREY
- Add a surface wind-wave model** ---- MARK
